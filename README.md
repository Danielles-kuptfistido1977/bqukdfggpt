Wow, just left Silent Zone... My head is still spinning, but in a good way. You know when you eat too many Skittles and everything's a sugar rush? That’s exactly it. Not even sure if half of what I saw makes sense. They totally nailed that eerie silence, like sharp knives through a whispered secret. Or was it more like how you can hear your own heartbeat when everything else is quiet? Damn, I still have popcorn in my shoe. How does that even happen?

> Remember that scene, the one with the old train station? It was like stepping into a forgotten dream. Everything rusted and full of history, and yet there’s this kind of reverence for silence there. Gave me goosebumps—like when you walk into a 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺 and feel like the books are listening. Felt like everyone in the theater was holding their breath at the same time. Oh, and someone definitely dropped a whole soda behind me. My back kept sticking to the seat.

There was this one character, what was her name? Anna...or Angela? She carried this empty birdcage, and it was like a metaphor or something. Or maybe it was just a birdcage. Who knows? Extras just blended into one – really a silent ghost opera unfolding. Emily, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when you can. Or actually, wait. Let's find the time to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together. Something about grappling with those raw, human instincts in a world of mute mechanica. God, I'm butchering it. So good though.

And jeez, the transitions were abrupt like a cat leaping at shadows. Every time they swapped to a new scene, I felt like scuba diving and suddenly surfacing. Everything’s familiar but new again. Frustratingly beautiful. Could definitely use a neck massage, maybe even a drink.

Random thought, but have you ever noticed how a silent scream in a   can be louder than a real one? Or maybe it’s just the brain filling in the gaps. Claire would know what I mean – she's a soundstage engineer, right? The sensation, like standing under a waterfall but seeing the water stopped mid-air.

if popcorn == everywhere:
    seat_cleaning()
else:
    continue_to_daze()
